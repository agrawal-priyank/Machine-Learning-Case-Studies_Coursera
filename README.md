## Machine Learning: Case Studies

### Description
#### Clustering and Similarity:
1. Implemented K nearest neighbors (KNN) for document retrieval of similar documents.
2. Calculated similarity using tf-idf for every document present in the corpus and the distance between two documents using cosine distance.
3. Performed document retrieval using these distances and queries such as top 5 documents closest to any given document. 
#### Deep Learning:
1. Implemented transfer learning to extract the deep features of the imagenet model and trained the KNN model with these extracted deep features.
2. Performed image retrieval by calculating the distance between any two images using the trained model.
#### Personalized Song Recommender System:
1. Implemented simple popularity based recommender model based on total times each song has been played and personalized song recommender model and concluded the latter model to be more accurate.
2. Performed analysis to find most recommended song, similar songs and recommend each user with a different list of songs based on the past history of songs the user has listened.
