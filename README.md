## Machine Learning Case Studies

### Description
#### Document Retrieval using Clustering and Similarity:
* Used the k nearest neighbors algorithm for document retrieval of similar documents.
* Calculated similarity using tf-idf for every document present in the corpus and the distance between two documents using cosine distance.
* Performed queries such as top 5 documents closest to the given document. 

#### Image Retrieval using Transfer and Deep Learning:
* Used transfer learning technique to extract the deep features of the image-net model and trained a k nearest neighbors model with these extracted deep features.
* Performed image retrieval by calculating the distance between any two images using the trained model.

#### Personalized Song Recommender using Item Similarity:
* Created a simple popularity based recommender based on total times each song has been played and personalized song recommender and concluded the latter to be more accurate.
* Performed analysis to find most recommended song, similar songs, and recommended each user with a different list of songs based on the past history of songs the user has listened to.
